## How to visit
ocassionaly avaliable at [47.37.113.251:8080](http://47.37.113.251:8080) . otherwise you can host it yourself.<br>

# To host it yourself 
> *note : the powershell scriptes are only to help automate docker commands. they are not necessary* <br>

### USING DOCKER-COMPOSE
 1. build & run the project with ```docker compose up -d --build```
 1. (do this step only when rebuilding the project) ssh into the psql DB container and run ```sh /setup/templateBuilder.sh``` (this cannot be easily automated with docker. i have tried \):  )
 1. visit <a href="http://localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a>

### USING POWERSHELL (not recommended/deprecated)
1. install Docker & clone this repo. turn on the docker daemon.
1. navigate to the folder containing [run_phpApache.ps1](https://github.com/Gregification/htmlfiddle/blob/main/run_phpApache.ps1) , note: addiitonsl paramaters are best found in the .ps1 script itself.
1. for the initial startup run ```.\run_phpApache.ps1 -rebuild -rebuildb``` , afterwards just ```.\run_phpApache.ps1``` will work.
    - ```.\run_phpApache.ps1 -help``` for help or see the param fields of [the script](https://github.com/Gregification/htmlfiddle/blob/main/run_phpApache.ps1) (starts line 5).
    - the ```-visit``` flag will open automatically open your browser to the site
1. check that [private_request/config.php](https://github.com/Gregification/htmlfiddle/blob/main/private_request/config.php)(generated when ```.\run_phpApache.ps1``` is ran) has the correct information for the psql db. the file [psqlConnecitonInfo.json](https://github.com/Gregification/htmlfiddle/blob/main/private_request/psqlConnectionInfo.json) is needed, its generated by the powershell script. it supplies the psql db's port & ip inside the docker network.


- to quit run ```.\run_phpApache.ps1 -stop``` or stop the containers manualy
- if the db is not initialized...  run ```sh /setup/templateBuilder.sh``` from inside the psql container. that should reset it to defaults, otherwise continue reading; pgsql setup: the ```pgsql_dirty.tar``` file ([stored in a google drive since too large(.7gb) for casual upload](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m2hxDKJHhBzIbTAJeKPh1kAFdB16_mnZ?usp=sharing)) is a .tar of a working postgresql db container saved as a iamge, then a container. use docker to create a image then container with it and make sure the name matches whats in the ```[string]$dbContainer = 'aphpsql'``` paramater in the powershell launch script aka. [run_phpApache.ps1 : around line#20](https://github.com/Gregification/htmlfiddle/blob/main/run_phpApache.ps1)
- sql conneciton error. using hte powershell script or initial starts may leave connection errors. fix this by opening <code>webserver/private_request/psqlConnectionInfo.json</code> and changing the value of the <code>iPv4</code> entry to the container name or ip of the database container (can be found with <code>docker network inspect</code>).

<!-- ## noteable
- there is no api. its just a bunch of POST calls back and forth. planning to switch over to one eventually -->
